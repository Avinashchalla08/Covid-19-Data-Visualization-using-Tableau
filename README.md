# Covid-19-Data-Visualization-using-Tableau
This is simple demonstration of data visualization and analysis of covid-19 data.
Included multiple data sources and visualized the data.
I have used measure names and dual axis to create a multiple line chart and many other techniques.
This shows the clear insights of covid-19 cases in India.
